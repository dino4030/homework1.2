    <p id="description">The beagle breed is a small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The beagle was developed primarily for hunting hare known as beagling.</br> Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and</br> foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent. It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.</br>

        The modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, the North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, </br>and possibly the Harrier.
        
        Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan times in literature and paintings and more recently in film, television,</br> and comic books.</p>
